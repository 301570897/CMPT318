#Data Exploration and Preparation
#Apply Feature scaling and Slice the dataset into as many complete weeks (Monday-Sunday) as possible. Compute the moving average for each complete week in the dataset using a fixed size moving time window. The outcome will be a ‘smoothened’ version of the input week. Now, create a new time series by computing the average value of all observations over each of the n smoothened weeks. Identify the most and the least anomalous weeks among the n weeks.
#Use your preprocessed dataset for training a number of univariate HMMs on Global_Active_Power. For each HMM, compute the log-likelihood measure on the training dataset.
